I am currently working as a buiness planner within the GTM team at [GitHub](https://pages.github.com/).  I started at GitHub 🥳 on October 19, 2021. Before GitHub I spent 6 years at Dassault Systemes working on the Go To Market for the BIOVIA brand portfolio.

I work remotely out of San Diego 🌤️, home since 2000, with roots from Portland, Oregon 🌧️ 🌲 where I grew up.  Most of the time you will find me 🏃‍♂️ 🚴‍♂️ 🏋️‍♂️ ⛷️ or watching my daughter play ⚽ 🏐.  I like to take time away to travel ✈️ to 🌴 destinations with lots of activities and places to explore 🥾.
