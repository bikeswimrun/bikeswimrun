I am currently working as a buiness planner within the GTM team at [GitHub](https://pages.github.com/).  Started at GitHub 🥳 on October 19, 2021 Before GitHub I spent 6 years at Dassault Systemes working on their portfolio for the BIOVIA brand.

Currently I'm in San Diego 🌤️, since 2000, but I grew up in Portland, Oregon 🌧️ 🌲.  Most of the time you will find me 🏃‍♂️ 🚴‍♂️ 🏋️‍♂️ ⛷️ or watching my daughter play ⚽ 🏐.  I like to take time away to travel ✈️ to 🌴 destinations with lot of adventure 🥾.

My daughter had fun with My Octocat <img src="https://octocat-generator-assets.githubusercontent.com/my-octocat-1635217766588.png" width="100" >
